# 3D Houses Project :

This project is a 3D rendering of the building at the address with the information obtained from the Ridar files, after receiving the GPS information of any address in the Flemish region entered by the user using the API provided by the state of the Flemish region.

The user can rotate and zoom the generated 3D image as desired.  The low resolution used Lidar files are in the DSM and DTM data files in the tiffs folder. The Ridar data file used has been selected with low resolution, it is sufficient to change the Ridar data file for more detailed information. 

The 3D building below is an example of how the building obtained by entering the address of KBC Tower in antwerpen is displayed to the user in 3D.


To try on your PC:
